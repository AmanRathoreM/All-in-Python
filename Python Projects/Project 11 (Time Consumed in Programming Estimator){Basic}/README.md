This project can be used if you want to know how much time you are spending in programming what you need to do is just run this code whenever you are starting programming and again run this code when you are finished with programming. And what this program do that save the time you had started programming and ended programming and now you have the data of when you had done programming or not and by simple [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/ "Click here to see what MatPlotLib is") ploting you can **Analysis** how much you do programming on an average in a day, or see there is growth in time consumed in programming or there is a downfall and you can do anything with stats
